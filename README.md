Dungeon-Crawler
===============

A text-based RPG written in Java. Currently it has only been tested on Windows and Android, and it requires a very specific path for its files.

At the moment the RPG does not have much content in it because it is meant to be extensible to any future stories that are desired to be created. Because of this, there has been an active attempt to store any possibly story-specific content such as character names, items, and locations in a specialised ".nam" file rather than coded into the project.
