Because of this, there has been an active attempt to store any possibly story-specific content such as character names, items, and locations in a specialised \".nam\" file rather than coded into the project.\r\n\r\n###Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project was created by Nam Tran (@omn0mn0m).\r\n\r\n[Back to User Page] (http://omn0mn0m.github.io)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
